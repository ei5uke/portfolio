Hello, I’m Eisuke (英祐), currently an undergrad generally interested in robot learning. I’ve a keen interest in (inverse) Reinforcement Learning and commonsense reasoning. As of now, I’ve mainly worked in quadruped locomotion and manipulation, as well as preference-based rl. My long-term mission is to contribute to the development of robots to human-inhabited environments (such as in hospitals or the home) that collaborate with us, with reasoning.
